# Task ID: 9
# Title: Create Final Dataset Merger and Output Generation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement system to merge all sequentially processed page results into final training dataset with proper formatting
# Details:
Implement merge_pages_to_dataset() that combines all page_txt/*.txt files into merged/dataset_full.txt in correct sequential order. Ensure proper ***** delimiter placement between pages. Add metadata header with processing statistics. Include duplicate paragraph detection and removal from overlapping windows. Generate summary statistics (total pages, characters, estimated tokens). CRITICAL: Merger must handle overlapping content from sequential window processing and maintain proper page order.

# Test Strategy:
Test merging with various page counts, verify delimiter consistency, test duplicate detection from window overlaps, validate final output format and sequential order
