# Task ID: 11
# Title: Deployment Strategy Development and Documentation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Establish comprehensive deployment strategy for CLI/script-based distribution via GitHub repository or package format, including complete documentation for installation, usage, examples, and precautions.
# Details:
Develop multi-channel deployment strategy: 1) GitHub repository distribution with setup.py/pyproject.toml for pip installation, 2) Standalone script package with bundled dependencies, 3) Docker containerization option. Create comprehensive documentation including: installation guide (pip install, manual setup, dependency requirements), CLI usage examples with real-world scenarios, configuration file templates, troubleshooting guide, performance optimization tips, and security considerations. Implement version management with semantic versioning and automated release workflows. Include requirements.txt, setup instructions for different OS platforms (Windows/Linux/macOS), and migration guides for updates. Document API rate limits, cost management, and best practices for large-scale processing. Create example scripts for common use cases and integration patterns.

# Test Strategy:
Test installation process on clean environments (fresh VMs/containers) for each deployment method. Verify all documented installation steps work correctly. Test CLI examples from documentation to ensure accuracy. Validate package dependencies and version compatibility. Test deployment on different operating systems. Verify documentation completeness by having team members follow installation and usage guides. Test automated release workflow and version management. Validate example scripts execute successfully.
