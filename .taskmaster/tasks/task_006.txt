# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop Text Post-processing and Paragraph Segmentation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement text cleaning, paragraph splitting, and delimiter insertion for training dataset preparation from sequentially processed pages
# Details:
Create process_extracted_text() function that: 1) Splits paragraphs longer than 800 characters using regex sentence detection, 2) Inserts ***** delimiters between sections, 3) Cleans up OCR artifacts and formatting issues, 4) Maintains proper paragraph structure for downstream LLM training. Use regex patterns for Korean/English sentence boundary detection. CRITICAL: Handle text from sequential window processing, managing overlap removal and continuity across page boundaries.

# Test Strategy:
Test with various text lengths and structures, verify paragraph splitting accuracy, confirm delimiter placement, test with multilingual content, validate overlap handling from sequential windows
