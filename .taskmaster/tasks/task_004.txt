# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Sequential Window Loading System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create overlapping page window system that processes N-1, N, N+1 pages together sequentially for context preservation while avoiding batch processing
# Details:
Implement create_page_windows() that groups 3 consecutive pages and processes them sequentially, never in parallel batches. Convert each group to base64 and package in parts array for Flash API. Handle edge cases for first/last pages. Implement PageJob data model with fields: id, imgs[3], status, retries, cost_est, error. Include logic to merge overlapping text results. CRITICAL: Process windows one at a time in strict sequential order to minimize token usage and prevent context overflow that leads to hallucinations.

# Test Strategy:
Test with pages that have text spanning boundaries, verify context preservation, test edge cases for document start/end, validate sequential processing order and memory efficiency
