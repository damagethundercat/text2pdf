# Task ID: 10
# Title: Large-scale PDF Production Testing and Quality Validation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 8, 7, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Conduct comprehensive end-to-end testing with real large-scale PDFs (800+ pages) to validate the entire automated pipeline including progress tracking, checkpoints, merging, and post-processing quality.
# Details:
Execute comprehensive production testing using actual large-scale PDFs (800+ pages) to validate the complete automated pipeline. Test scenarios include: 1) Full pipeline execution from start to finish with progress monitoring, 2) Checkpoint recovery testing by intentionally interrupting processing at various stages, 3) Memory usage and performance monitoring during sequential window processing, 4) Quality validation of final merged dataset including proper delimiter placement and duplicate removal, 5) Cost tracking accuracy and budget limit enforcement, 6) Error handling and recovery mechanisms under real-world conditions. Document processing times, memory consumption, API costs, and output quality metrics. Establish baseline performance benchmarks for production deployment. CRITICAL: This testing determines project completion readiness - successful processing of 800+ page PDFs with high-quality output marks the project as production-ready.

# Test Strategy:
Test with multiple large PDFs (800-2000+ pages) of varying complexity (text-heavy, image-heavy, mixed content). Verify complete pipeline execution without failures. Test checkpoint recovery by stopping processing at 25%, 50%, 75% completion and resuming. Monitor memory usage throughout processing to ensure no memory leaks. Validate final dataset quality by sampling random pages and checking for proper formatting, delimiter placement, and absence of duplicates. Verify progress tracking accuracy by comparing estimated vs actual completion times. Test cost tracking precision and budget enforcement. Document all performance metrics and establish production readiness criteria.
