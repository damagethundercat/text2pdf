# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement PDF to PNG Conversion Module
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create PDF preprocessing module that converts PDF pages to PNG images using pdf2image library for sequential page-by-page processing
# Details:
Implement convert_pdf_to_images() function using pdf2image.convert_from_path(). Handle DPI settings (default 300, resize if too large). Save images as PNG format with sequential naming (0001.png, 0002.png, etc.). Include error handling for corrupted PDFs and memory management for large files. CRITICAL: This module prepares individual page images for sequential window-based processing - never batch process all pages at once to avoid context overflow and hallucination risks.

# Test Strategy:
Test with sample PDFs of various sizes, verify PNG output quality and file naming convention, test memory usage with large PDFs, validate sequential page extraction for window processing
