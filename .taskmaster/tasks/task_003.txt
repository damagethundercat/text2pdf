# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Single Page Flash Extraction PoC
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create proof of concept for extracting text from single page using Gemini 2.5 Flash API with strict sequential processing
# Details:
Implement extract_text_from_image() using google.generativeai library. Configure model with temperature=0.0 and 'professional proof-reader' system prompt. Convert PNG to base64 for API submission. Handle API responses and extract text content. Include cost estimation and token counting. CRITICAL: This function processes only single pages or small window groups (max 3 pages) to minimize context consumption and prevent hallucination errors that occur with large batch inputs.

# Test Strategy:
Test with various page types (text-heavy, mixed content, poor quality scans), verify OCR accuracy and proofreading quality, validate cost calculations, confirm single-page processing limits
