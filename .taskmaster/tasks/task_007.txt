# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Page-level Checkpoint Storage System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create checkpoint system that saves individual page results and enables resume functionality for sequential processing
# Details:
Implement save_page_result() to store individual page text in page_txt/NNNN.txt format. Create checkpoint tracking with JSONL logging (LogLine model: timestamp, level, page_id, message). Implement resume_from_checkpoint() to skip already processed pages and continue sequential processing from the correct window position. Include success/failure status tracking and cost accumulation. CRITICAL: Checkpoint system must track sequential window progress to resume processing at the exact correct position without skipping or duplicating windows.

# Test Strategy:
Test checkpoint creation and resume functionality, verify JSONL log format, test recovery from various failure points, validate sequential window position tracking
