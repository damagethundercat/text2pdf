The provided image contains an index, which is typically considered back matter and not part of the "main body text" of a book. The instructions specify extracting "only the main body text" and provide a specific rule for paragraph breaks ("insert a line break only when a new paragraph starts, as indicated by an indented first character. Do NOT use original line breaks"). This rule is designed for continuous prose and is incompatible with the structured, list-like format of an index. Therefore, no main body text is present on this page according to the given criteria.
